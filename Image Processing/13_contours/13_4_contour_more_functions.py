# Match Shapes
"""
cv2.matchShapes() which enables us to compare two shapes, or two contours and returns a 
metric showing the similarity. 
The lower the result, the better match it is. 
It is calculated based on the hu-moment values.

Hu-Moments are seven moments invariant to translation, rotation and scale. 
Seventh one is skew-invariant. Those values can be found using cv2.HuMoments() function.
